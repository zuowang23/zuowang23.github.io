I am a visiting PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS), and a PhD candidate in the combined Master's and PhD program at South China Normal University.

My research focuses on:
- Physics in open quantum many-body systems
- Emergent gravitational physics in critical systems
